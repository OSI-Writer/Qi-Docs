Introducing Qi
##############

Qi is a highly flexible cloud-based sequential data historian that you use to store, retrieve, and analyze data. You create and write data to *streams* using a simple REST (*REpresentational State Transfer*) API (*Application Programming Interface*). The streams you create are used to store simple or complex data types to suit your application needs. An assortment of methods with customizable behaviors are available to read data and easily obtain needed information.

Architecture
------------

The primary object of the Qi architecture is the *tenant*. Within a tenant you create one or more 
*Namespaces*, in which data types are defined and data is stored.

You use Namespaces to separate tenants into logical entities. For example, 
you might want to have one Namespace for production, one for development, and 
perhaps another to serve as a pre-production staging area where your QA 
group can run certification testing.

Within a Namespace, Qi defines three different objects in which to store and manage data:

-  **Type**: A user-defined structure that denotes a single measured event or
   object for storage. In Qi, a type is called a QiType.
-  **Stream**: A basic unit of storage consisting of an ordered series of
   objects that conform to a type definition. In Qi, a strea is called a QiStream.
-  **Stream Behavior**: Defines how Qi interpolates or extrapolates
   data during event retrieval when requests occur before, after, or between
   existing data events.

Each Namespace stores a separate and independent list of Type, Stream, and Stream Behavior objects.
