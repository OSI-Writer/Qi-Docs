Qi is a cloud-based highly flexible sequential data historian that can
be used to store, retrieve and analyze data. Users create and write data
to streams using a simple REST API. The streams can store simple or
complex data types to suit the application needs. An assortment of
methods with customizable behaviors are available to read data and
easily obtain needed information.
