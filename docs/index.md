Qi is a cloud-based highly flexible sequential data historian that can be used to store, retrieve and analyze data. Users create and write data to streams using a simple REST API. The streams can store simple or complex data types to suit the application needs. An assortment of methods with customizable behaviors are available to read data and easily obtain needed information.

## Getting started
Familiarization with Qi and its capabilities is easy. Introductory information such as API references can be found in [Overview](https://qi-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Overview/). In order to use the Qi REST API in your applications, make sure you have the following requirements:

- A computer
- A set of tools that you feel comfortable using to consume and use RESTful Web Services
- If consuming the .NET Qi Client Libraries, you must be using tools capable of using the .NET 4.6 Runtimes in your enviroment
- A Qi Preview tenant from OSIsoft and corresponding set of OAuth2 authentication keys
